We've Just completed an intensive programming assignment for our Data Structures and Algorithms course, and we're thrilled to share our journey and achievements!

Project Overview:
In preparation for the upcoming Olympics, we were tasked with developing a dynamic data structure in Java to manage and efficiently query statistics about runners and their run times. The structure needed to support various operations such as adding/removing runners, recording/removing run times, and calculating statistics like the minimum and average run times.

Key Elements:
1. Data Structures::
    * 2-3 Trees: Used for organizing and efficiently querying runners' run times. One tree stored the 
      minimum run times, and another stored the average run times.
    * Custom Classes: Implemented Runner, Run, and Race classes to encapsulate runner data and 
      manage the operations efficiently.
2. Algorithms:
    * Insertion and Deletion: Efficiently handled with logarithmic complexity using the 2-3 tree properties.
    * Statistics Calculation: Quickly computed minimum and average run times using the balanced nature 
      of 2-3 trees.

Implementation Details:
* Initialization: Designed the Race class to initialize the race data structure.
* Adding Runners: Implemented methods to add runners to the structure with unique IDs.
* Recording Run Times: Developed methods to record unique run times for each runner.
* Removing Data: Included functionality to remove runners and specific run times.
* Querying Statistics: Efficiently computed and retrieved statistics like minimum and average run times.

 Lessons Learned:
* Efficient Data Management: Gained deeper insights into managing large datasets efficiently using 
   balanced trees.
* Algorithm Optimization: Improved understanding of optimizing algorithms for time complexity.
* Java Mastery: Enhanced my proficiency in Java, particularly in implementing custom data structures.
